## Schema

### Required

- `execution_frequency` (String) The frequency at which the script is enforced. Options: `once` (runs once and never again), `every_15_min`, `every_day`, `no_enforcement` (manual run only).
- `name` (String) The name of the Custom Script.
- `script` (String) The shell or zsh script content. Must include a valid shebang (e.g., `#!/bin/zsh`).

### Optional

- `active` (Boolean) Whether this library item is active.
- `remediation_script` (String) An optional script that runs only if the primary script fails (exits non-zero).
- `restart` (Boolean) Whether to restart the computer if the script execution is successful. Use with caution as this may disrupt users.
- `show_in_self_service` (Boolean) Whether to make this script available for users to run manually in the Self Service app.

### Read-Only
