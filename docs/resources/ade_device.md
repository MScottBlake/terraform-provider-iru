# iru_ade_device (Resource)

Manages an Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) device record. These records represent devices synced from Apple Business Manager before they are fully enrolled in MDM. This resource allows managing assignments like blueprint and user. Note: ADE Devices cannot be created via Terraform; they must be imported after syncing from Apple.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# ADE Devices cannot be created via Terraform, only imported and managed.
# Use 'terraform import' or 'terraform query' to bring them into state.

resource "iru_ade_device" "example" {
  blueprint_id = "your-blueprint-uuid"
  asset_tag    = "LAB-1234"
  user_id      = "user-uuid"
}
```
