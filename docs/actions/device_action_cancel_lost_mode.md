  Sends a cancelation request if Lost Mode is in an error state. This is an error-recovery/administrative action used when the Lost Mode state is 'stuck'. Instead of just telling the device to stop, it attempts to clear the record/request cycle that might be preventing the device from updating. Use this only if the standard disable command has failed or if the Iru console shows the device is in an error state regarding its Lost Mode status.
