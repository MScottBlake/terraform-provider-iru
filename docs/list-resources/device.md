# iru_device (List Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# This file defines a query to find existing devices for bulk import.
# Run 'terraform query' to see the results.

list "iru_device" "macbooks" {
  provider         = iru
  include_resource = true
  limit            = 500

  # Example of provider-specific query configuration if supported
  # config {
  #   platform = "macOS"
  # }
}

# After running 'terraform query', you can use the results in an import block:
/*
import {
  for_each = list.iru_device.macbooks
  to       = iru_device.managed[each.key]
  id       = each.value.id
}

resource "iru_device" "managed" {
  for_each = list.iru_device.macbooks
  # attributes will be populated by terraform query -generate-config-out
}
*/
```
